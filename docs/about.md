# Fru Dev
This is a hub for exploring data, AI, and modern development — where ideas evolve into real solutions and knowledge is shared with clarity and purpose.

It brings together practical insights, experiments, and stories from the front lines of building with today's technologies.

## Fru Labs

Nested within Fru Dev, **Fru Labs** serves as the experimental playground. 

This is where bold ideas are tested — blending platforms like Snowflake, Cursor, Slidev, and AI into prototypes, demos, and frameworks. Some projects stay experimental, while others mature into polished solutions, tutorials, or tools released to the community.
