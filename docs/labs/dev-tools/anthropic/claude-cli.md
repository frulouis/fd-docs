   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

3. **Authenticate with Claude Code**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
   - Complete the one-time OAuth process
   - You'll need active billing at console.anthropic.com
   - Follow the on-screen instructions

## Usage Modes

### Interactive REPL Mode
Launches an interactive prompt for conversational development:

```bash
claude
```

Use this when you want to:
- Iterate on ideas
- See conversational history
- Ask questions about your codebase
- Execute complex commands

### Single Command Mode
Run a single instruction directly from the command line:

```bash
claude "Generate a Flask route for the home page"
```

Perfect for quick edits or script-like usage.

## Building Applications with Claude

### Basic Application Development

1. **Initialize a New Project**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-app
   cd my-app
   git init
   echo "# My App" > README.md
   ```

2. **Scaffold with Claude**
   ```bash
   claude "Create a basic Python Flask app with a single route that returns 'Hello, World!'"
   ```

3. **Enhance the Application**
   ```bash
   # Add routes
   claude "Add a '/about' route to the Flask app that returns 'About Page'"
   
   # Add API endpoints
   claude "Add an '/api/status' route that returns a JSON response with uptime and status"
   
   # Improve structure
   claude "Refactor the Flask routes into a Blueprint in a new 'routes.py' file"
   ```

### Code Analysis and Improvement

Claude excels at understanding and improving existing code:

```bash
# Analyze code structure
claude "analyze the current Flask app structure and suggest improvements"

# Find security issues
claude "find potential security issues in the authentication system"

# Optimize performance
claude "optimize the database queries in the user management module"
```

### Git Workflow Automation

Claude can help automate common Git operations:

```bash
# Commit changes
claude "commit my changes"

# Create pull requests
claude "create a pr"

# Resolve conflicts
claude "rebase on main and resolve any merge conflicts"
```

## Advanced Features

### Configuration Management

```bash
# View current configuration
claude config

# Set specific model
claude config set model claude-3-sonnet-20240229
```

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

```bash
# View current context
claude mcp list

# Add file to context
claude mcp add app.py

# Clear context
claude mcp clear
```

### System Health Check

```bash
# Run full system check
claude doctor
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompting
- Be specific about what you want to achieve
- Provide context about your project's requirements
- Use clear, descriptive language
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps

### Code Quality
- Review AI-generated code before committing
- Test thoroughly, especially for critical functionality
- Maintain consistent coding standards
- Document complex logic and decisions

### Security Considerations
- Never include sensitive information in prompts
- Review generated code for security vulnerabilities
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure you have an active Console account with billing enabled
- **Node Version**: Ensure you're using Node.js version 18 or higher
- **Version Mismatch**: Check your version with `claude --version`
- **Model Issues**: Run `claude doctor` to diagnose problems
