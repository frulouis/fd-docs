## Sample Data

The data model includes comprehensive sample data covering:
- **3 Customers** with different segments and loyalty tiers
- **3 Products** across electronics and clothing categories
- **3 Stores** in major US cities
- **3 Orders** with complete transaction details
- **4 Inventory records** across stores and warehouses

## Usage Examples

### Customer Analytics
```sql
-- Find high-value customers
SELECT * FROM customer_analytics 
WHERE customer_segment = 'High Value' 
AND lifetime_value > 2000;

-- Customer retention analysis
SELECT customer_segment, 
       AVG(days_since_last_order) as avg_days_since_order,
       COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM customer_analytics 
GROUP BY customer_segment;
```

### Product Performance
```sql
-- Top performing products
SELECT product_name, total_revenue, times_ordered, conversion_rate
FROM product_performance 
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Products needing reorder
CALL generate_reorder_recommendations();
```

### Sales Analytics
```sql
-- Sales by channel and source
SELECT channel, utm_source, 
       COUNT(*) as orders,
       SUM(total_amount) as revenue
FROM sales_analytics 
GROUP BY channel, utm_source;
```

### Inventory Management
```sql
-- Low stock alerts
SELECT product_name, store_name, current_stock, reorder_point
FROM inventory_analytics 
WHERE stock_status = 'Reorder Needed';
```

## Stored Procedures

### Customer Management
- `calculate_customer_lifetime_value()` - Updates customer lifetime value based on order history

### Inventory Management
- `update_inventory_levels()` - Updates current stock levels
- `generate_reorder_recommendations()` - Identifies products needing reorder

### Data Maintenance
- `cleanup_old_data(days_to_keep)` - Removes old data based on retention policies

## Data Governance

### Tags Applied
- **data_owner**: Team responsible for data management
- **data_classification**: Data sensitivity level (PII, Financial, Operational, Business)
- **retention_policy**: Data retention period in years

### Security Considerations
- Customer PII is tagged for special handling
- Financial data has appropriate access controls
- Audit trails track all data modifications

## Integration Examples

### Snowflake Features
- **Time Travel**: Track data changes over time
- **Clustering**: Optimize query performance on large tables
- **Data Sharing**: Share specific views with partners
- **External Tables**: Connect to external data sources

### Business Intelligence
- **Customer Dashboards**: Real-time customer insights
- **Inventory Reports**: Stock level monitoring and alerts
- **Sales Analytics**: Multi-dimensional sales analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: KPI tracking and reporting
