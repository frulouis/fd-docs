# Welcome to Fru Labs

Master modern data engineering with comprehensive Snowflake tutorials, AI/ML guides, and hands-on projects.

!!! quote "🌏 Curiosity, meet developing."
    I'm Fru, and Fru Labs is my sandbox where curiosity collides with code. From AI and data to Cursor, Snowflake, and Slidev, this is where concepts turn into experiments — and experiments turn into tools, tutorials, and communities. Less theory. More Developing.
