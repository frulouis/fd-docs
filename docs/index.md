# Welcome to Fru Labs

Hi, I'm Fru ðŸ‘‹ â€” I build, experiment, and learn in public at the intersection of data, AI/ML, and modern development tools.

!!! quote "Learning in Public, Building in Public."
    The emergence of AI makes it incredibly easy to build. This site is part of my journey of building and learning in public â€” where curiosity collides with code, and experiments turn into tools, tutorials, and communities. Less theory. More Developing.
