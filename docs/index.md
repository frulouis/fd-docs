# Welcome to Fru Labs

Hi, I'm Fru ðŸ‘‹ 

This site is part of my journey of building and learning in public.

In this space you get to witness a bit of curiosity colliding with code, and experiments grow into tools, tutorials, and communities.  

Less theory, more building. 

Everything here is evolving, experimental, and shaped by what Iâ€™m exploring at the moment. 

Perfection isn't the goal; but if errors are salient, do let me know. 

My hope is that youâ€™ll find a spark of inspiration to learn, build, and **DEVelope** something of your own.  


!!! quote "Learning in Public, Building in Public."
    The best way to experience the future is to pull it forward through building, experimenting, learning, creating, and sharing what you discover along the way.
