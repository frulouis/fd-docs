_**Assistant**_

I'll help you rename the GitHub repository from `fd-docs` to `fd-labs`. This involves updating the repository name on GitHub and then updating any local references to reflect the new name.

Let me start by checking the current repository configuration and then guide you through the process.


---

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs % git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/frulouis/fd-docs.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/frulouis/fd-docs.git (push)
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs %
```

---

Perfect! I can see that the current repository is `fd-docs` and you want to rename it to `fd-labs`. Here's what we need to do:

## Steps to Rename the Repository:

### 1. Rename on GitHub (Manual Step)
You'll need to do this manually on GitHub:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/frulouis/fd-docs
2. Click on "Settings" (in the repository menu)
3. Scroll down to the "Repository name" section
4. Change "fd-docs" to "fd-labs"
5. Click "Rename"

### 2. Update Local Git Remote
Once you've renamed it on GitHub, I'll update your local git remote to point to the new repository name:


---

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/frulouis/fd-labs.git
```

```
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs % git remote set-url origin https://github.com/frulouis/fd-labs.git
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs %
```

---

### 3. Verify the Change
Let me verify that the remote URL has been updated:


---

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs % git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/frulouis/fd-labs.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/frulouis/fd-labs.git (push)
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs %
```

---

### 4. Test the Connection
Let's test that the connection works with the new repository name:


---

```bash
git fetch origin
```

```
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs % git fetch origin
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/frulouis/fd-labs.git/' not found
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs %
```

---

The error indicates that the repository hasn't been renamed on GitHub yet. Here's what you need to do:

## Complete Instructions:

### Step 1: Rename on GitHub (You need to do this)
1. Go to https://github.com/frulouis/fd-docs
2. Click on **Settings** (in the repository menu)
3. Scroll down to the **"Repository name"** section
4. Change "fd-docs" to "fd-labs"
5. Click **"Rename"**

### Step 2: Verify the Rename
Once you've renamed it on GitHub, come back and let me know. I'll then test the connection to make sure everything is working properly.

### Step 3: Update Any Documentation References
After the rename is complete, we should also check if there are any references to the old repository name in your documentation that need to be updated.

**Important Notes:**
- GitHub will automatically redirect old URLs to the new ones
- All existing clones and forks will continue to work
- The repository will be accessible at the new URL: https://github.com/frulouis/fd-labs

Let me know once you've completed the rename on GitHub, and I'll help you verify everything is working correctly!

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now let's test the connection to make sure the repository rename was successful:


---

```bash
git fetch origin
```

```
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs % git fetch origin
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs %
```

---

Perfect! The repository rename was successful. Let's also verify the current status:


---

```bash
git status
```

```
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs % git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .gitignore
        modified:   .specstory/history/2025-09-06_00-47Z-replicate-site-design-for-tutorials.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
frunde@Inspireds-MacBook-Pro fd-labs %
```

---

Excellent! The repository has been successfully renamed from `fd-docs` to `fd-labs`. Here's a summary of what we accomplished:

## ✅ Repository Rename Complete

### What was done:
1. **Updated local git remote** - Changed from `https://github.com/frulouis/fd-docs.git` to `https://github.com/frulouis/fd-labs.git`
2. **Verified connection** - Successfully fetched from the new repository URL
3. **Confirmed status** - Your local repository is up to date with the renamed remote

### Current status:
- ✅ Repository renamed on GitHub: `fd-docs` → `fd-labs`
- ✅ Local git remote updated to point to new URL
- ✅ Connection verified and working
- ✅ Your local repository is up to date with `origin/main`

### Next steps (optional):
If you want to update any documentation that might reference the old repository name, you can search for "fd-docs" in your codebase and update those references to "fd-labs". The repository is now fully functional with its new name!

Your repository is now accessible at: https://github.com/frulouis/fd-labs
